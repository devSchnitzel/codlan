A online "LAN" system for Black Ops 3 (Playstation 4)

I'm not affiling with Activision/Call of Duty/Treyarch/Playstation (it's a home made code without any piracy).
This code is for learn only.

After the DCMA Takedown of the original project (see here): https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2018/11/2018-11-06-CallofDuty.md the code have been reverified for doesn't include any other copyrighted content (for me, but you are free to talk with me for any other infringement), i have misunderstood what is copyrigted in the original project because alot of website have already use this before.
